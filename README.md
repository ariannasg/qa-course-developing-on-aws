## Description
The QA "Developing on AWS" course it's a mix of instructor-led training and hands-on labs to understand how to use the 
AWS SDK to develop secure and scalable cloud applications. It provides in-depth knowledge about how to interact with AWS 
using code, and covers key concepts, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.

## Objectives
Main Objectives:
* Configure IAM permissions to support your development environment.
* Design, diagram, build, and deploy a cloud-native application using AWS SDKs.
* Monitor and maintain an application by using AWS resources.

Learning Outcomes:
* Set up the AWS SDK and developer credentials for Java, C#/.NET, Python, and JavaScript
* Interact with AWS services and develop solutions by using the AWS SDK
* Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for service authentication
* Use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB as data stores
* Integrate applications and data by using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and AWS Step Functions
* Use Web Identity Framework and Amazon Cognito for user authentication
* Use Amazon ElastiCache to improve application scalability
* Use containers in the development process
* Leverage the CI/CD pipeline to deploy applications on AWS

Course Overview:
* Module 1 – Introduction to the course. 
* Module 2 – Review the details the AWS architecture used to create a complete cloud-native application. 
* Module 3 – Explore the benefits of AWS software development kits (AWS SDKs) when building an application.
* Module 4 – Configure a development environment that supports AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. 
  * Lab 1 – Configure and test IAM permissions in a development environment.
* Module 5 – Compare feature sets and use cases for available AWS storage solutions. 
* Module 6 – Deploy a static website to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
  * Lab 2 – Identify the appropriate AWS solutions for application workloads for big data.
* Module 7 – Compare feature sets and use cases for available AWS database options. Configure an Amazon DynamoDB database to store data from a web application.
* Module 8 – Use the DynamoDB SDK to perform the create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations, and explore database caching options.
  * Lab 3 – Configure a DynamoDB database to store data from a web application.
* Module 9 – Compare the feature sets and use cases for available AWS compute solutions. Build an AWS Lambda function to store data from a web application in DynamoDB.
  * Lab 4 – Build an AWS Lambda function to store data from a web application in DynamoDB. 
* Module 10 – Explore the methods available for Amazon API Gateway to connect AWS resources. 
  * Lab 5 – Use Amazon API Gateway to connect Lambda and DynamoDB.
* Module 11 – Evaluate the benefits of building a web application using a serverless approach. 
* Module 12 – Review how Amazon Cognito controls user access to AWS resources. 
  * Lab 6 – Create an Amazon Cognito solution that provides users access to a web application. 
* Module 13 – Deploy your application.
* Module 14 – Identify the AWS services that support the monitoring of a web application. 
  * Lab 7 – Deploy, monitor, and maintain a web application using AWS resources. 
* Module 15 – Course summary
